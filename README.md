A couple of considerations:

## Improvements:

1. This definitely needs something like React Virtual Window because the DOM Nodes can get WAY too
   big.
2. Cards need an accordion or something to that effect in order to hide all the extra info.

## Technical debt:

It´s been an hectic week. I´ve unit tested most components, but I couldn´t do an integration test
on App to see if everything put together was working properly.
